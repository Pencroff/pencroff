Hi. My name is Sergey Daniloff. I am a responsible and result-driven full-stack web-developer.
I always educate myself in using simple and elegant solutions for difficult tasks.
I am master in wider range of computer languages (_JavaScript_ /_Typescript_, _Python_ or _.NET_),
software architecture, OOP, functional or reactive concepts.   
Always eager to improve and learn more, using all my maturity and engineering experience to surpass all problems.
Currently I am improving my experience in Machine Learning area.
