Presentation about new features in Angular 2.0, a bit of history and technical details for decorators / annotations, change detections and templates syntax. Of course comparison performance between angular 1.x and angular 2.0 (alpha) was mentioned. An example of Angular 2.0 (alpha-33), ToDo application with Babel, SystemJS and DI (3 components and model) was presented in demo . It’s a first demo with all original functionality (to be honest I didn’t find existing example with all features so has worked out of the box).
