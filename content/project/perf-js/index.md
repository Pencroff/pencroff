Compare performance different JavaScript approaches in your browser.
Developed with Angular 4 (with example of localizations English / Ukrainian).
Since that time I participated in number of migrations from [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org) to [Angular 2+](https://angular.io)
and from [CanJs](https://v3.canjs.com) to [React](https://reactjs.org) (hook based app)
