Hi. My name is Sergey. Recently I decided to create a blog and note interesting things.

Here you go - my very first post.

As an engineer, I currently like to play with Golang, Python, and JavaScript or TypeScript (I started with JS way before it started to be so popular).
<!--more-->
Python is a king of data analysis and data science. We have to know what can be gained from data. 

Golang surprised me by its restrictions for lotâ€™s of popular things in other languages (no inheritance for example) and platform-native executable after compilation (including WebAssembly ðŸ˜‰).

So please check the set of posts about my current [2048 project](/project/proj-2048/) implemented in golang and based on the [ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) game engine.
