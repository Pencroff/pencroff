During my recent passing of the Pluralsight course on cloud technologies, I came across an intriguing fact that piqued my interest: although it may be hard to believe, pigeon-posting – the ancient method of delivering messages by releasing homing pigeons – still exists in some form in today's digital age. <!--more-->However, it is essential to acknowledge that this antiquated practice has undergone significant transformations since the advent of the Internet.

In essence, pigeon-posting has morphed into something more akin to a "data box" rather than a physical post. Despite its evolution, there remains a tangible aspect to this method as it still involves transferring data from one location to another physically. For instance, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer the Snow Family and Azure their Data Box solutions that enable businesses to transfer large amounts of data, measured in terabytes and petabytes – using physical devices for secure, efficient, and cost-effective transfer.

While pigeon-posting may seem an archaic contrast to these modern methods, both share the common goal of transporting information from one place to another. To delve deeper into this topic and learn more about the various offerings from AWS and Azure, I invite you to explore further resources such as the [AWS Snow Family](https://aws.amazon.com/snow/) documentation or the [Azure Data Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databox) product page.
