Attendees did some training with AngularJs. I did an implementation of back-end for MEAN stack. More details about implementation you could find in my repo. Implementation base on Express with token authorization for private API and no authorization for public API. I developed api which recognizes name of the model as an url parameter and then picks available repository from Unit of work.</description></item><item><title>Kea config</title><link>https://pencroff.com/project/kea-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pencroff.com/project/kea-config/</guid><description>Configuration manager for Node.js applications with perfect performance and without dependencies.
