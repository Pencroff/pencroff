They provide a way to distinguish between different entities and ensure data accuracy and consistency.
However, generating unique IDs can be challenging due to several factors such as data complexity, scalability,
and security concerns. In this article, we will explore the specific challenges that arise during the process
of generating unique IDs and how they can be addressed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fluky - random number generator library</title><link>https://pencroff.com/post/fluky-lib/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pencroff.com/post/fluky-lib/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was always curious about Random Number Generator (RNG) implementation. The magic how from few numbers inside it generates long sequence &amp;ldquo;randomly&amp;rdquo; distributed numbers. I did few experiments on my ZX Spectrum with it limited performance. And this article I would like to share the &lt;a href="//github.com/Pencroff/fluky">fluky&lt;/a> library.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
