To mitigate the Birthday Problem, it has been maximized the random aspect. Monotonicity is achieved through random incremental increments (up to 50% of the random bit size), and overflows are resolved by increasing time and regenerating new random parts without errors or exceptions.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Generating IDs</title><link>https://pencroff.com/post/the-art-of-generating-ids/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pencroff.com/post/the-art-of-generating-ids/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unique identifiers (IDs) are critical elements in many applications and systems.
They provide a way to distinguish between different entities and ensure data accuracy and consistency.
However, generating unique IDs can be challenging due to several factors such as data complexity, scalability,
and security concerns. In this article, we will explore the specific challenges that arise during the process
of generating unique IDs and how they can be addressed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
