To mitigate the Birthday Problem, it has been maximized the random aspect. Monotonicity is achieved through random incremental increments (up to 50% of the random bit size), and overflows are resolved by increasing time and regenerating new random parts without errors or exceptions.</description></item><item><title>Unveiling the Power of CCID in Go: A Comprehensive Guide</title><link>https://pencroff.com/post/ccid-go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pencroff.com/post/ccid-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever struggled with generating unique and meaningful IDs in your Go applications?

They provide a way to distinguish between different entities and ensure data accuracy and consistency.
However, generating unique IDs can be challenging due to several factors such as data complexity, scalability,
and security concerns. In this article, we will explore the specific challenges that arise during the process
of generating unique IDs and how they can be addressed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
