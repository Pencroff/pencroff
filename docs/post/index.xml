The magic how from few numbers inside it generates long sequence &amp;ldquo;randomly&amp;rdquo; distributed numbers. I did few experiments on my ZX Spectrum with it limited performance. And this article I would like to share the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Pencroff/fluky">fluky&lt;/a> library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proj 2048</title><link>https://pencroff.com/post/proj-2048/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pencroff.com/post/proj-2048/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few years ago Gabriele Cirulli developed a sliding puzzle where the goal is to grow tiles and get up to 2048. My
“Proj 2048” is about implementing several agents to play. Which should get tiles up to 4096 or maybe even 64536 (if

My name is Sergey. Recently I decided to create a blog and note interesting things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here you go - my very first post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an engineer, I currently like to play with Golang, Python, and JavaScript or TypeScript (I started with JS way before it started to be so popular).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
